#Setup
Before we get started please ensure that the following packages are installed and running.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lattice")
install.packages("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
```

The Applied Predictive Modeling package contains a concrete dataset that we can experiment with.  I thought it would be good to use a dataset that our company actually deals with.
